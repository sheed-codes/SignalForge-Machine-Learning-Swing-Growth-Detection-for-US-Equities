# SignalForge-Machine-Learning-Swing-Growth-Detection-for-US-Equities
This project explores quantitative methods for detecting potential short-term growth opportunities in US equities using machine learning and feature-based modeling.  The goal is NOT to predict prices directly, but to identify statistical signals associated with forward returns using structured time-series features.
